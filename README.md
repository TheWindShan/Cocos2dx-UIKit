#Cocos2dx UIKit integration

This is an example of how to integrate iOS UIKit with Cocos2d-x

Contains two examples of navigation: Cocos2d-x is presented in modal view and with [SWRevealViewController](https://github.com/John-Lluch/SWRevealViewController) as main navigation controller.   
This project is built with Xcode 6.4 and Cocos2d-x v3.8 <del>(with some [minor modifications](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13816))</del>.  
  
**Note:** This example only demostrates UIKit integration, has no support for device orientation and is built for iOS only, all other platforms where disabled/removed.
